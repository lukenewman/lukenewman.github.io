PlayToPay is an iOS app that was created over the course of a weekend at HackGT 2015. My idea was to create a modern take on credit card roulette. PlayToPay helps a group of friends, family, coworkers, or whoever decide who should pick up the check or tab. Players compete in a series of minigames, and whoever scores the worst picks up the tab. The app also features Venmo integration so the loser can charge the rest of the group and make up for some or all of the tab. I was the head iOS developer working on the full stack.

The app was featured on [Hypepotamus](http://www.hypepotamus.com/companies/play-to-pay/).

You can find more information about the app on its [website](www.playtopayapp.com).

You can also find it on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/playtopay/id1043929720?mt=8).
