Happnin was a project built while I was studying abroad at Georgia Tech Lorraine in Spring 2015. It is the first iOS app I've written, and it was created as part of a group project for a Mobile Apps & Services class.

With Happnin, users get a real-time look into what's happening at popular places around them. Users choose between four different nightlife venue types, then choose a specific venue, and are then presented with a mixed feed of geotagged Instagram and Twitter posts from that particular venue. The idea here was to be a sort of Snapchat My Story for venues.

Please head over to the [product site](http://happnin.herokuapp.com) to learn more about the app.

*Technologies Used*: Objective-C, RestKit, Yelp API, Instagram API, Twitter API
