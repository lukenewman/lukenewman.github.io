Spots is an application developed with Plutonium Apps for Spots Development Group from August - October 2016.

From the [website](http://www.tryspots.com):

"Spots is a social application that enables college students to travel on a budget or simply make new friends in town! Using Spots, you can find other students who are offering their living space at an affordable price. You can also list your own “Spot” as an easy way to make some extra cash and meet new people. Just identify your location, name a competitive price, and wait for a request from a fellow student! The app allows fast booking times through an easy-to-navigate map interface, intuitive profile pages, and a swift and reliable payment method."

I worked remotely on the initial version of the app with another iOS developer who handled the backend while I developed the frontend. The initial version included owner and spot profile pages, a map view with pins for spot locations, a request system á la Airbnb, and a settings page for payment information for Braintree.

Since completion of the initial version in October 2016, the owners have performed more business development and put the app into beta testing. Hopefully it will show up on the App Store soon!

*Technologies Used*: Swift, Firebase, Braintree, Facebook SDK
