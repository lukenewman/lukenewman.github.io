In August 2015, I started working for Agency Spotter, a local Atlanta startup whose services help connect marketers and design firms. I built from the ground up their first iOS app, a companion to their main service. The app allows marketers to search through thousands of design agencies and create shortlists of the best candidates for their next projects.

You can find out more about the app on its [website](http://mobileapp.agencyspotter.com).

The app is currently Waiting For Review for the App Store.

*Technologies Used*: Objective-C, SimpleAuth, RestKit, Masonry, Chameleon, SDWebImage, Fabric, Crashlytics, Onboard
