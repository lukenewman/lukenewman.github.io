Hey, y'all

I'm Luke, a 3rd-year Computer Science major at Georgia Institute of Technology. I enjoy creating awesome experiences with iOS apps, among other things.

I’ve had plenty of work experience in the past two years: one summer of full-time employment at Manhattan Associates, a supply-chain software and consulting firm, and two additional positions working on iOS apps at two Atlanta startups.

I have been interested in iOS since the App Store first debuted, but I didn’t start building my own apps until a little over a year ago. Since then, I’ve built around six apps as class assignments, commissioned work, and personal fun side projects. Along with a couple of friends, I also just founded an iOS club at Georgia Tech to teach others iOS development and share our love for the platform.

The status and availability of the apps I’ve worked on varies — some can be found on the App Store, others on my Github, others are still in development and may be private. You can find a comprehensive portfolio of my works on this very website! (Hint: Just go "Home".)

I have a very strong grasp on iOS development fundamentals and building apps from scratch; I’m looking for an internship that can provide for me an opportunity to advance my skills by maintaining and augmenting an established product with a large user base. If this sounds like someone you would want to hire for an internship, please drop me a line via email or hit me up on Twitter, LinkedIn, or GitHub.

Thanks for stopping by!

~ Luke
