Hey, y'all

I'm Luke, a 4th-year Computer Science major at Georgia Institute of Technology graduating in May 2017. I enjoy creating awesome experiences with iOS apps, among other things.

I’ve had plenty of work experience in the past three years: one summer of full-time employment at Manhattan Associates, a supply-chain software and consulting firm, and two additional positions working on iOS apps at two Atlanta startups. This past summer, I worked as Big Nerd Ranch's iOS Intern. Currently I'm continuing my work there as a part-time iOS Developer while I finish up my degree.

I have been interested in iOS since the App Store first debuted, but I didn’t start building my own apps until around two years ago. Since then, I’ve built multiple apps as class assignments, commissioned work, and personal side projects. Along with a couple of friends, I also last year founded the GT iOS Club to teach others iOS development and share our love for the platform.

The status and availability of the apps I’ve worked on varies — some can be found on the App Store, others on my Github, others are still in development and may be private. You can find a comprehensive portfolio of my works on this very website! (Hint: Just go "Home".)

I have a very strong grasp on iOS development fundamentals and building apps from scratch; I’m looking for an internship or full-time opportunity that can provide for me an opportunity to advance my technical, managerial, and entrepreneurial skills. If this sounds like someone you would want to hire, please drop me a line via email or hit me up on Twitter, LinkedIn, or GitHub.

Thanks for stopping by!

~ Luke
